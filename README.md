# Uncommon Python Error: Incompatible Data Types in Arithmetic Operations

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python that can occur when performing arithmetic operations on incompatible data types.  The code includes a function that attempts to handle `TypeError` and `ZeroDivisionError`, but also showcases how to gracefully handle unexpected exceptions.

The `bug.py` file contains the code with the error, while `bugSolution.py` offers a solution for handling various exceptions that may arise from incompatible data types.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bug.py`
3. Observe the output and the exception handling.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file provides a robust solution by explicitly checking data types and handling different exceptions appropriately.
